# From here is sell_coins.js script called until there are no coins left in table
# sell_coins script shouldn't be called from here until there are no coins left because that can loop
# one coin and fuck up all the other coins. Instead the coin should be left in table and examined while
# other coins are sold.



# if the transaction fails and decimal is 18 change it to 9


# if the transaction succeeds then delete it from sell coins
